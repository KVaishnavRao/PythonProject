# 🎙️ Speech-to-Text Recognition with NLP Tokenization

This project captures live audio from a microphone, converts it into text using **Google Speech Recognition API**, and then processes the recognized text using **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit). The tokenized words are displayed for further Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
